Welcome to the Collabo Project

This is an experimental application to create a collaborative website where
people can post and link up to all kinds of artistic expressions on a private
or public wall.  I hope to also offer a way to create projects that will be a collection of these artistic things and can then be "published" or made public.  The idea is to create some kind of artistic collaborative or just a way for artists to collect and publicize their created works.
